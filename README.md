## Build instructions

```bash
make
```

It should compile all the java source files that need to be re-built. The build has been tested with GNU compiler Linux (Fedora 26).

## Usage

From the Command Prompt, type "java" with a class name of the main program. As example, if Main.java (having the main function) produces Main.class after compliation, then type as below:

```bash
java Main
```

If all goes well, the output of the program should be displayed/generated.
